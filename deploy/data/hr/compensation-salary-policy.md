### 3.1 Positioning Within a Band

An employee's position within their salary band is determined by:
- Experience and tenure
- Performance ratings (see HR-POL-005)
- Specialized skills and certifications
- Internal equity comparisons

## 4. Annual Salary Reviews

- Salary reviews are conducted **once per year** during the month of **April**.
- All increases are effective **May 1** of the review year.
- Merit increases are determined by the employee's most recent annual performance rating:

| Performance Rating   | Typical Merit Increase |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Exceeds Expectations | 5% – 8%               |
| Meets Expectations   | 2% – 4%               |
| Needs Improvement    | 0%                     |

- Employees rated "Needs Improvement" are not eligible for a merit increase and will be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) per HR-POL-006.

## 5. Promotions and Adjustments

- Promotional increases are typically **8% – 15%** of the employee's current base salary.
- Market adjustments may be made outside the annual review cycle with VP-level approval and HR concurrence.
- Cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) are evaluated annually and applied at the company's discretion.

## 7. Overtime

- Non-exempt employees (Levels 1–5) are eligible for overtime pay at **1.5× their regular hourly rate** for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek.

## 4. Goal Setting

- Each employee must set **3 to 5 measurable goals** aligned with team and company objectives.

- Goals must be entered in the **Performance Management System** and approved by the employee's manager by January 31.

## 5. Mid-Year Check-In

The mid-year check-in is a mandatory conversation between the employee and their manager to:
- Review progress against goals
- Identify obstacles and adjust goals if necessary
- Discuss development opportunities

No formal rating is assigned during the mid-year check-in. A written summary must be recorded in the Performance Management System.

## 6. Self-Assessment

Employees are required to complete a self-assessment in November covering:
- Progress and achievements against each goal
- Key contributions and impact
- Areas for development
- Career aspirations

## 7. Manager Assessment & Calibration

- Managers assess each direct report against goals and competencies.
- **Calibration sessions** are held at the department level to ensure fairness and consistency of ratings across teams.
- Calibration decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

## 8. Feedback & Delivery

- Final performance reviews must be delivered in a **one-on-one meeting** between the manager and employee.
- Reviews must not be delivered solely via email or the Performance Management System.
- Employees must acknowledge receipt of their review by signing in the system within 5 business days.

## 9. Impact on Compensation

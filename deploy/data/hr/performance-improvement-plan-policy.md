## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the process for placing an employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) when their work performance does not meet expectations.

## 2. When a PIP Is Initiated

A PIP may be initiated when:

- An employee receives a **"Needs Improvement"** rating in their annual performance evaluation.
- An employee's performance deteriorates significantly between evaluation cycles, as documented by their manager.
- A manager identifies a pattern of missed deadlines, quality issues, or failure to meet role expectations.

A PIP is **not** a disciplinary action. It is a structured support tool designed to help the employee return to satisfactory performance.

## 3. PIP Process

### 3.1 Documentation

The manager must complete a **PIP Document** that includes:

- Specific performance gaps with concrete examples
- Clear, measurable improvement objectives (2–4 objectives)
- Resources and support to be provided (e.g., training, mentoring, reduced workload)
- A timeline for improvement: **30, 60, or 90 days** depending on the severity of the gaps
- Consequences of not meeting objectives (up to and including termination)

### 3.2 HR Review

All PIP documents must be reviewed and approved by HR **before** being shared with the employee. HR will ensure the plan is fair, specific, and legally defensible.

### 3.3 PIP Meeting

The manager and HR conduct a meeting with the employee to:

- Present the PIP document
- Discuss expectations and support
- Allow the employee to ask questions
- Obtain the employee's signature acknowledging receipt (signature does not imply agreement)

### 3.4 Check-Ins

- **Weekly check-ins** between the employee and manager are required during the PIP period.
- A written summary of each check-in must be recorded and shared with HR.

## 4. PIP Outcomes

At the end of the PIP period, one of the following outcomes applies:

| Outcome               | Action                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objectives Met**     | PIP is closed. Employee returns to regular performance management. A follow-up review is conducted after 90 days. |
| **Partial Progress**   | PIP may be extended once for an additional 30 days with HR approval. |
| **Objectives Not Met** | Employment may be terminated in accordance with HR-POL-010 (Termination Policy). |

## 5. Employee Rights

- The employee may provide written comments or objections at any point during the PIP.
- The employee may request a meeting with HR independently of their manager.
- PIP records are maintained in the employee's confidential personnel file for **3 years** after closure.

## 6. Manager Responsibilities

- Managers must provide genuine support and resources throughout the PIP period.
- Failure to conduct weekly check-ins or provide documented support may result in the PIP being voided by HR.

## 1. Purpose

This policy describes the annual bonus and incentive programs available to eligible employees at Contoso Ltd.

## 2. Eligibility

- All full-time employees who have been employed for at least **6 months** as of December 31 of the bonus year are eligible.
- Employees on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) at the time of bonus calculation are **not eligible**.
- Employees who resign or are terminated before the bonus payout date forfeit their bonus.

## 3. Bonus Structure

### 3.1 Annual Performance Bonus

The annual bonus is calculated as a percentage of the employee's base salary, based on job level and performance rating:

| Level   | Target Bonus (% of Base) |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| 1–3     | 5%                       |
| 4–5     | 10%                      |
| 6–7     | 15%                      |
| 8–9     | 20%                      |
| 10+     | 25% – 40%               |

**Performance Multiplier:**

| Performance Rating     | Multiplier |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Exceeds Expectations   | 1.25×      |
| Meets Expectations     | 1.0×       |
| Needs Improvement      | 0×         |

**Example:** A Level 6 employee with a base salary of $120,000 and an "Exceeds Expectations" rating would receive: $120,000 × 15% × 1.25 = **$22,500**.

### 3.2 Company Performance Factor

The total bonus pool is adjusted by a **Company Performance Factor (CPF)** ranging from **0.5× to 1.5×**, determined by the Board of Directors based on annual financial results. The CPF is communicated to employees in February.

### 3.3 Spot Bonuses

Managers may award **spot bonuses** of up to **$2,000** to recognize exceptional contributions outside the regular evaluation cycle. Spot bonuses require one-up manager approval and must be reported to HR.

## 4. Bonus Calculation & Payout

- Bonuses are calculated in **January** and paid out in **March** of the following year.
- Bonuses are subject to applicable tax withholdings.
- Bonus amounts are confidential and must not be disclosed to other employees.

## 5. Sales Incentive Compensation

Employees in designated sales roles participate in a separate **Sales Incentive Plan (SIP)** with quarterly payouts. Details are governed by individual SIP agreements and are not covered by this policy.

## 6. Clawback Provision

Bonuses may be subject to clawback if, within 12 months of payout, it is determined that:
- The employee engaged in misconduct or policy violation
- Financial results upon which the bonus was calculated are materially restated
